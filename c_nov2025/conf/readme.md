This directory contains an example configuration file. It could be used for
the configuration of the repos to have data pulled from, or the 
credentials that are used to authenticate to github if this is required. This could be
passed in at runtime or at deployment and the value of the token stored in a key vault.
This would only be if reading from private repositories such as in an organisation on 
GitHub.
